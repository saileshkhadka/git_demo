# If you’ve never used git or github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do..
1. Get your signup on Github account.
2. Download and install git to your local machine, you can get Git from url: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Setup git username and email for first use: 
	
	Open terminal/bash and type 
	$ git config --global user.name "Your name here"  => It will configured your username
	$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com" => It will configured your user email.

4. Setup SSH on your local machine using git bash.

6. Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings i.e,
	Go to your github Account Settings
